# Realtime Patterns

### [Realtime Service](https://github.com/anton-ecom/patterns/tree/main/docs/realtime/realtime-service.md)

A consumer-facing abstraction for subscribing to realtime events, regardless of the underlying provider (Supabase, WebSocket, GUN, etc).
See [tree/main/docs/realtime/realtime-service.md](https://github.com/anton-ecom/patterns/tree/main/docs/realtime/realtime-service.md) for details and examples.

### [Realtime Provider &amp; Channel](https://github.com/anton-ecom/patterns/tree/main/docs/realtime/realtime-provider-channel.md)

Low-level abstractions for implementing realtime transports and channels.
See [tree/main/docs/realtime/realtime-provider-channel.md](https://github.com/anton-ecom/patterns/tree/main/docs/realtime/realtime-provider-channel.md).
